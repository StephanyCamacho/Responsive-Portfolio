                <p>My name is Stephany, and I am currently learning how to code through DU's Coding Bootcamp. I have a B.F.A. in Digital Design and have always had a curiousity to learn how to code.

                I hope to use the skills in this class to be able to receive a job in UX/UI design. Although I have not worked in any sort of design agency, I believe I have gained valuable experience working in assistive technology, where I currently work at. I've realized the importance of universal design and being able to create websites that cater to all audiences regardless of disability. It's definitely given me a different perspective when thinking about accessibility.

                One of my favorite things to do is to go out on long walks with my dog. I also enjoy going hiking and taking on new trails. I'm not a Colorado native, so I'm no expert in hiking. But I do enjoy pushing my limits and seeing how much more challenging of a trail I can take on. </p>
